# Hey there, my name is Mohammad.

I am currently working as a Software Development Manager in New York City.

I have had the privilege of growing up surrounded with technology in some shape or form, starting from my brother’s Commodore 64 and Atari to having my own PC. I also enjoy building my own PCs, casual gaming and just a general tech enthusiast. It was inevitable for me to work in some form of technology. I chose the route of web development as the internet always intrigued me when it first became accessible worldwide. I started web development from high school when I worked on my first website for myself and then for some other businesses. I was also interested in traditional programming languages and while in high school I took trainings for MS Visual Basic and then focusing on Java and attaining a Java programming certificate at an early age.

Ideally, I would have worked as a programmer while going to college, but it was the year 2001 right around the dotcom bust so I just took the traditional path and pursued a Computer Science degree but continued my focus towards web development and eventually landed a full-time position as a software engineer. From there I continued to climb the ladder immersing myself in leadership, Agile/Scrum, SDLC, program management, people management, and cloud services.

If you’d like to work with someone who is deeply passionate about technology, pushing for self and team growth, efficiency, and high impact feel free to email me: mkhan0104 at gmail dot com.
